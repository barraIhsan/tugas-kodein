<h1>Mecca</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>Mecca</strong> (/'mɛkə/; officially <em>Makkah al-Mukarramah</em>,<sup>[a]</sup> commonly shortened to <strong>Makkah</strong><sup>[b]</sup>) is the capital of Mecca Province in the Hejaz region of western Saudi Arabia and the holiest city in Islam.<sup>[2]</sup> It is 70 km (43 mi) inland from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley 277 m (909 ft) above sea level. Its last recorded population was 1,578,722 in 2015.<sup>[3]</sup> Its estimated metropolitan population in 2020 is 2.042 million, making it the third-most populated city in Saudi Arabia after Riyadh and Jeddah.<sup><em>[citation needed]</em></sup> Pilgrims more than triple this number every year during the <em>Ḥajj</em> pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of <em>Dhūl-Ḥijjah</em>.</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>Mecca has been referred to by many names. As with many Arabic words, its etymology is obscure.<sup>[19]</sup> Widely believed to be a synonym for <em>Makkah</em>, it is said to be more specifically the early name for the valley located therein, while Muslim scholars generally use it to refer to the sacred area of the city that immediately surrounds and includes the Ka'bah.<sup>[20]21]</sup></p>

<h3>Bakkah</h3>
<p><em>Main article: Bakkah</em></p>
<p>The Quran refers to the city as <em>Bakkah</em> in Surah Al Imran (3), verse 96: "Indeed the first House [of worship], established for mankind was that at Bakkah". This is said to have been the name of the city at the time of Abraham (Ibrahim in Islamic tradition) and it is also transliterated as <em>Baca, Baka, Bakah, Bakka, Becca and Bekka,</em> among others.<sup>[22][23][24]</sup> It was a name for the city in the ancient world.<sup>[25]</sup></p>

<em><h3>Makkah, Makkah al-Mukarramah and Mecca</h3></em>
<p><em>Makkah</em> is the official transliteration used by the Saudi government and is closer to the Arabic pronunciation.<sup>[26][27]</sup> The government adopted <em>Makkah</em> as the official spelling in the 1980s, but it is not universally known or used worldwide.<sup>[26]</sup> The full official name is <em>Makkah al-Mukarramah</em> (Arabic: مكة المكرمة, lit. 'Makkah the Honored').<sup>[26]</sup> <em>Makkah</em> is used to refer to the city in the Quran in Surah Al-Fath (48), verse 24.<sup>[19][28]</sup></p>

<h3>Other names</h3>
<p>Another name used for Mecca in the Quran is at 6:92 where it is called <em>Umm al-Qurā</em>, meaning "Mother of all Settlements". The city has been called several other names in both the Quran and <em>ahadith</em>. Another name used historically for Mecca is <em>Tihāmah</em>.<sup>[32]</sup> According to an Islamic suggestion, another name for Mecca, <em>Fārān</em>, is synonymous with the Desert of Paran mentioned in the Old Testament at Genesis 21:21.<sup>[33]</sup> Arab and Islamic tradition holds that the wilderness of Paran, broadly speaking, is the Tihamah coastal plain and the site where Ishmael settled was Mecca.<sup>[33]</sup> Yaqut al-Hamawi, the 12th-century Syrian geographer, wrote that <em>Fārān</em> was "an arabized Hebrew word, one of the names of Mecca mentioned in the Torah."<sup>[34]</sup> (See also:Wadi Faran)</p>

<h2>Significance in Islam</h2>
<p>Mecca holds an important place in Islam and is considered the holiest city in all branches of the religion. The city derives its importance from the role it plays in the Hajj and 'Umrah and for its status as the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad.</p>

<h3>Masjid al-Haram</h3>
<p>The <em>Masjid al-Haram</em> is the site of two of the most important rites of both the Hajj and of the Umrah, the circumambulation around the Ka'bah (tawaf) and the walking between the two mounts of Safa and Marwa (sa'ee). The masjid is also the site of the Zamzam Well. According to Islamic tradition, a prayer in the masjid is equal to 100,000 prayers in any other masjid around the world.<sup>[100]</sup></p>

<h4>Kaaba</h4>
<p><em>Main article: Kaaba</em></p>
<p>There is a difference of opinion between Islamic scholars upon who first built the Ka'bah, some believe it was built by the angels while others believe it was built by Adam. Regardless, it was built several times before reaching its current state. The Ka'bah is also the common direction of prayer (qibla) for all Muslims. The surface surrounding the Ka'bah on which Muslims circumambulate it is known as the Mataf.</p>

<h4>Hajr-e-Aswad (The Black Stone)</h4>
<p>The Black Stone is a stone, considered by scientists to be a meteorite or of similar origin and believed by Muslims to be of divine origin. It is set in the eastern corner of the Ka'bah and it is Sunnah to touch and kiss the stone. The area around the stone is generally always crowded and guarded by policemen to ensure the pilgrims' safety. In Islamic tradition, the stone was sent down from Jannah (Paradise) and used to build the Ka'bah. It used to be a white stone (and was whiter than milk). Because of the worldly sins of man, it slowly changed color to black over the years after it was brought down to Earth.</p>

<h2>Human resources</h2>
<p>Formal education started to be developed in the late Ottoman period continuing slowly into Hashemite times. The first major attempt to improve the situation was made by a Jeddah merchant, Muhammad ʿAlī Zaynal Riḍā, who founded the Madrasat al-Falāḥ in Mecca in 1911-12 that cost £400,000.<sup>[109]</sup> The school system in Mecca has many public and private schools for both males and females. As of 2005, there were 532 public and private schools for males and another 681 public and private schools for female students.<sup>[119]</sup> The medium of instruction in both public and private schools is Arabic with emphasis on English as a second language, but some private schools founded by foreign entities such as International schools use the English language as the medium of instruction. Some of these are coeducational while other schools are not. For higher education, the city has only one university, Umm Al-Qura University, which was established in 1949 as a college and became a public university in 1981.</p>
